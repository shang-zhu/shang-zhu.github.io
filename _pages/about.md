# Particularly, I leveraged modern machine learning techniques, such as active learning and graph machine learning, to accelerate materials design and optimization. I also developed atomistic-scale and meso-scale modeling tools to investigate interfacial physics of batteries.

# Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a researcher at Together AI, working on efficient ML algorithms. I obtained my PhD degree at the University of Michigan, and a Master's at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to that, I did my undergradudate study at Xi'an Jiaotong University, China.

My general research interests lie in the intersection of computational intelligence, energy and environment. During my PhD research, I worked with [Dr. Venkat Viswanathan](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/viswanathan-venkat/) at U-M on designing computational algorithms for battery materials discovery. After graduation, I became motivated by the emerging field of large language models (LLM), and joined Together AI to build energy-efficient algorithms for LLM inference.
