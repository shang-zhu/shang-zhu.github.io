# Particularly, I leveraged modern machine learning techniques, such as active learning and graph machine learning, to accelerate materials design and optimization. I also developed atomistic-scale and meso-scale modeling tools to investigate interfacial physics of batteries.

# Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a PhD student of Mechanical Engineering advised by [Venkat Viswanathan](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/viswanathan-venkat.html) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie in the intersection of computational intelligence, energy and environment. I received my Master's in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and Bachelor's in Xi'an Jiaotong University. I did a research internship at Microsoft Research Redmond (2022), working with [Bichlien H. Nguyen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/bnguy/) and [Jake A. Smith](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jakesmith/).

Our group will move to University of Michigan--Ann Arbor in 2023 Fall, where I will finish my PhD degree. **Iâ€™m actively looking for research positions in industry and academia now.** If you have job openings or are interested in collaborations, please feel free to contact me.
